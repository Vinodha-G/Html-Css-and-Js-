    <b>About</b>      I'm Vinodha, a passionate <i>Software Engineer</i>  currently diving into <u>full stack development with Java.</u>
     With a strong foundation in object-oriented programming and experience in securing user data through advanced cryptography, I thrive on solving complex problems.
      My academic journey includes a bachelor's degree in Engineering, where I completed projects like securing cloud data using elliptic curve cryptography and creating AI-driven solutions for small-scale farmers.
     <p>
        I'm now expanding my <s>skills</s> in full stack development, aiming to build dynamic and responsive applications. Outside of coding, I share insights with my 4.5k Instagram followers.
        Let's connect and create something impactful together!
